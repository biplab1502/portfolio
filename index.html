      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Success is a term that means different things to different people. For some,
        success may mean reaching a certain level of financial stability or professional achievement. In contrast, for
        others, success may mean having a fulfilling personal life or positively impacting the world. This blog post
        will discuss how to define success and what it means to you.

      <p class="sectionTag text-big">What do you mean by Education</p>
      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and
        manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as public
        schools. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system,
        while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal
        education are categorized into levels, including early childhood education, primary education, secondary
        education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on teaching methods, such as teacher-centered and
        student-centered education, and on subjects, such as science education, language education, and physical
        education. Additionally, the term "education" can denote the mental states and qualities of educated individuals
        and the academic field studying educational phenomena.

      <p class="sectionTag text-big">What do you mean by Technology</p>
      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge for achieving practical
        goals, especially in a reproducible way.[1] The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such
        efforts,[2][3] including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software.
        Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.
        Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The earliest known technology is the
        stone tool, used during prehistoric times, followed by the control of fire, which contributed to the growth of
        the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age. The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age
        allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines. More recent technological inventions,
        including the printing press, telephone, and the Internet, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in
        the knowledge economy
